some issues may affect the performance:

1.Data too less
2.Points too sparse
    feature not enough
    feature similar to negative object 
    
3.Ground truth not labbeled properly:
    Misguide the network during training
    Correct detection become false positive when the gt is not labbel, AP calculated wrongly
    Bounding box not aligned nicely, affect IOU

Solution:
1. More data
2. Data augmentation
3. Fix the labbels and bounding boxes
4. Filter number of points
5. More validation set
